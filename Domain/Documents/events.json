Then, a deck of cards is shuffled and dealt to each player. The objective of the game is to collect four cards of the same rank, such as four Queens or four 3s. Once the cards have been dealt, the dealer takes a card from the deck and places one of their cards face down in the center of the table. The card is then passed around the table, with each player taking a card from the deck and passing one of their cards to the player on their left. The goal is to get four of a kind as quickly as possible. Once a player has four of a kind, they grab a spoon from the center of the table. As soon as other players notice that a spoon has been taken, they must also grab a spoon as quickly as possible. The player who doesn't grab a spoon is eliminated from the game, and one spoon is removed from the center of the table. The game continues until only one player remains, and they are declared the winner. Take a picture of your initial setup, and then a picture of the winner. Also throw in a picture of the person who gets eliminated first.",

The game is played with two ping pong balls, a table, and a set of plastic cups.\nTo start the game, the cups are arranged in a circle in the center of the table, and a small amount of beverage is poured into each cup. Two participants start with a cup in front of them and each hold a ping pong ball. They begin the game by trying to bounce the ping pong ball into the cup. If they make it on their first try, the participant can pass the cup to anyone in the table. If they do not make it their first try, they must pass it to the person next to them clock wise. The objective of Rage Cage is to bounce the ball into the cup, and then pass the ball and cup to the next player before they make their shot. Players continue to play in this manner, bouncing the ball into the cup and then passing it on, until someone makes a shot before the player before them has successfully passed the ball and cup to them. When this happens, stack the cup into the next person's cup, pass that stack to the following person, and the person who was stacked must pull another cup from the center and drink its contents and bounce the ball into that cup. The game continues in this manner, with players trying to stack cups as quickly as possible and forcing others to drink. The last person to be stacked on must drink the contents of the ~ loser cup ~.",

The defending team attempts to catch the die one-handed after it hits the table, but before it touches a non-table surface. The game typically consists of two two-player teams with each of the four players having a designated cup on the table, but can also be played one-vs-one.\nThe game begins with one player from each team rolling the die, the team rolling the highest number will be able to choose either side or first toss. Players must say ~die~ before tossing to signal the impending throw. The die must travel higher than 8 feet (2.4 m) from the ground. If the opposing team disputes the height, the shot does not count. A point is awarded if the die hits the table and bounces off the defensive side of the table without being properly caught. The defending team may catch the die to nullify potential points scored. The die must be caught with one hand (juggling is permitted) but must not be trapped between any surface or body part or a point is awarded. Once the die comes in contact with the floor or stops moving, the play is dead and a point is awarded. If the die strikes the cup on a toss, the team is awarded 2 points. If the die is thrown into the opposing team’s cup the throwing team is awarded 3 points and the thrower is permitted to sign the table. This game is played on a standard sheet of plywood (8 by 4 feet (2.4 by 1.2 m) of at least 1⁄2 inch (13 mm) thickness) placed on banquet tables. The game uses a standard solo cup. ",

Even if you are suspicious that you are the subject of a conversation it is not really sociably acceptable to find out, plus you will give away that you have been eavesdropping. You also look a fool if you make a scene only to find out your paranoia was misguided!\nGather your team in a circle. The first player whispers a ‘who’ question into the ear of the person on the right. For example, ~ who has the prettiest smile ~. The person asked the question says out loud the name of the person they think is the answer. That person, no matter where they are on the table, now has a decision to make. They can either find out the question that caused them to be the answer or they can play on and ask a new question. If they want to find out the question though they have to drink or rock paper scissors for the privilege. If they lose rock paper scissors, they do not find out, and the game moves on to the next who question. ",
