Users are able to sign in and sign up with their apple account. 

They then go through the flow to create an account, which asks them to choose a name and upload a picture for their profile. 

They are then introduced to the front of the app.

Here 105 premade events are fetched and filtered with their according tags. Each event has a name, description, rules to complete, tips to complete, and a photo to go along with it.
The events are set up in a way where in the front screen, I can choose themes for the day and assign tags accordingly so it'll change the label header names
and corresponding events. There are also hosted events made by teams that are location based. You can choose a team destination to filter out closest teams.
